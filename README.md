<h1>Project 1: Drum Kit</h1>
<p>Went through Wes Bos JS30 Project 1. Completed each feature by myself, as best as possible, before continuing his video to see his
implementation and/or get a hint.</p>

<h2>Skills learned:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Playing audio and reset it after key pressdown.</li>
<li>Keyboard keys each have their own key code.</li>
<li>transitionend event- run callback function after css transition has ended for that element.</li>
</ol>
