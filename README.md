<h1>Wes Bos' JS 30 Course</h1>
<p>In this course, I follow individual tutorials provided by instructor Wes Bos in which I am to complete a total of 30 Javascript projects. With each project, I learn from the instructional videos provided, look up and research important JS methods used to get a better understanding, and in some parts I challenge myself to complete the code on my own before proceding with the instructor's code implementation.</p>
